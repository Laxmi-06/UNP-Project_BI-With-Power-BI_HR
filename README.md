# UNP-Project_BI-With-Power-BI_HR
Completed this Project as a Part of my Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP)

Contributed to the Development of Intricate KPIs and Dynamic, Interactive Power BI interfaces. Collaborated with Stakeholders to understand their requirements and translated them into effective Power BI Solutions. Ardently involved in Creating Data Model, Implemented Data Transformations and Calculations using DAX for accurate analysis and Reporting.

Through this project, I've honed my skills in data preprocessing techniques such as removing null values and column splitting, along with transforming date formats. I've used DAX to calculate and discover a range of insightful metrics:

1.Attrition Rate: Calculating the attrition rate within the workforce.
2.Active Employees: Determining the count of currently employed individuals.
3.Gender Distribution: Segregating employees into male and female categories.
4.Promotion Statistics: Identifying employees eligible for promotion dues.

DASHBOARD UTILIZATION:

1.Pie Chart for Departmental Division: Depicting the distribution of employees across different departments.
2.Stacked Column Charts for Promotion by Department: Illustrating promotion statistics categorized by departmental divisions.
3.Donut Chart for Attrition by Business Travel: Displaying attrition rates based on various business travel categories.
4.Donut Chart for Salary and Overtime Work: Highlighting salary distribution for employees working overtime.
5.Slicer for Age: Providing an interactive tool to filter data based on age groups.
